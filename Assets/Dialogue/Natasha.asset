  dialogue:
  - Oh, hello there. I didn't expect to see anyone out here, especially not you.
  - "You seem a bit lost, but that's nothing new around here. Everyone\u2019s trying
    to figure out what comes next... The question is, are you ready for the truth?"
  - "What if I told you that there are more ways to win than just choosing one or
    the other? But then again, those paths... they come with consequences. Maybe
    you\u2019re not ready for that. Or maybe you are."
  - "I\u2019ll let you think on it. But don\u2019t be too quick to decide. Life has
    a funny way of making us regret the choices we make, especially when the heart
    is involved."
