  dialogue:
  - "Ah, finally, you've arrived. I\u2019ve been waiting for you\u2026 it seems fate
    has brought us together. I knew you\u2019d come, even though the world tried
    to pull us apart. You\u2019re special, aren't you? So special... that you deserve
    something beyond the ordinary."
  - You see, there are two paths before you. The key... it's tempting, isn't it?
    The power it offers, the safety, the guarantee. But is that truly what you want?
    Is that what your heart longs for?
  - "The heart... now that\u2019s something different. The heart will choose me,
    and with me, you could have everything. Everything you've ever dreamed of, a
    life of luxury and fulfillment... if you just trust me."
  - Think about it. The key is an illusion, a temporary fix. But with me, we can
    rule the future. A future where we are invincible... where I can make all your
    dreams come true.
  - "The choice is yours, but remember: the heart will choose me, and with me, you
    will be invincible. Don\u2019t let their lives hold you back. You know what you
    truly want deep down\u2026 don\u2019t fight it."
  - "I\u2019ll be waiting, of course. Whenever you\u2019re ready to make the right
    choice, I\u2019ll be here, by your side\u2026 forever. Don\u2019t take too long,
    though... time is fleeting, and so is our chance."
