  dialogue:
  - The forest whispered of your arrival. It rarely whispers kindly.
  - You seek answers... perhaps I can offer you a glimpse.
  - "Edric sent you, didn\u2019t he? "
  - He's charming, isn't he? Too charming, perhaps.
  - "There\u2019s something about him... a shadow he tries to keep hidden."
  - "But don\u2019t let me worry you... I\u2019m just a witch spinning riddles."
  - Still... if you feel the cold creep in when he's near, trust your skin.
  - Not all is as it seems, child. Even light can lie.
  - Come again if you survive the next dusk... I might tell you more.
